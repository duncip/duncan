# Let's see if the plots show up automatically

I would also like to see *if simply* doing some **bolding** works or not.

And also:

* Can

* We

* Use

* Lists?

## Actual plot

Get the tidyeerse package loaded

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
theme_set(theme_ipsum_rc())
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars
```

And what about the plot?

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = .7, fill = "midnightblue")
```
